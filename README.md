## Implementation Team
- Entire team created initial file structure & data flow.
- Jacob researched on add/delete buttons.
- Aryan created initial functionality to load JSON data into HTML.
- Shilpa fixed styling and reviewed pull requests to merge.
- Ethan implemented task expansion features and moving tasks to the bottom once completed.
- Ryan added additional styling and color based on json priority data.

### Notes
- Difficult to implement adding and deleting buttons because you have to write directly to the JSON files
  - noted as a limitation
- Could have some more dynamic interactions
- Not viewport responsive (won't look great on mobile device)
